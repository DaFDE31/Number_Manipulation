# Number_Manipulation

# Goal

Please complete the four methods in the Numbers class to see if they work in the Tests class.

## IsPrime
This method takes an int as input and return true if it is prime and false if it is not.


## Factor Sum
Add up all the factors of the integer input and return the Sum.

## Pythagorean Triple Count
This method is meant to represent the pythagorean theorem.
You are meant to find how many combinations of 3 integers (a,b,c) can make right a triangle based on the input n. 
```
Rules: 0 < A < B < C <= N
EX: 
n=10 -> 3,4,5 ->  return: 1
n=17 -> [3,4,5] , [5,12,13] , [6,8,10] , [8,15,17] , [9,12,15] -> return: 5
```

## Sum of Digits
Given a string of numbers, return the sum of all numbers in the string.
```
EX: 
"" ->  0
"3" ->  3
"45" ->  9
"12345" ->  15
```
